## Overview

This project is a demonstration of my React Native animation skills.

Through the commit history, you would be able to follow my first attempt using a purley state method before caving in and Googling for an example of synchronising two scroll views.

I am aware that I did not quite complete all of the features set out in the video but I feel like I have demonstrated my React Native level and my determination to complete this task.

I will continue to develop my skills and enjoyed learning new aspects of the React Native framework having never previously had to animated something using the Animation API.

## Features
